---------------

SQRL Authentication Library in Rust <https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm>.

This is very much WIP at the moment, it's not usable as a library yet.
Published to <https://crates.io/crates/libsqrl>.

To build it you need at least rust 1.31.0, and cargo for the dependencies.

```
cargo build --release
cargo test
```
